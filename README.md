# variable = A container for a value(string, integer, float, boolean)
# Typecasting = the process of canverting a variable from one data type to another
# input() = a function that prompts the user to enter data returns the entered data as a string
# IF = Do some code only IF some condition is True
# ELSE = do something else
# Logical Operators = evaluate multiple canditions (or, and, not)
#                    or = at least one candition must be True
#                    and = both conditions must be True
#                    not = inverts the condition (not False, not True)
# Conditional Expression = A one-line shortcut for the if-else sataement (ternary operator)
#                          Print or assign one of two values based on a condition
#                          X if condition else Y
# .isalpha() returns boolean if a string only contians alphabetical characters
# indexing = accessing elements of a sequence using [] (indexing operator)
#           [start: end : step]
format specifiers = {value:flags} format a value based on what flags are inserted

  .(number)f = round to that many decimal places (fixed point)
  :(number) = allocate that many spaces
  :03 = allocate and zero pad that many spaces
  :< = left justify
  :> = right justify
  :^ = center align
  :+ = use a plus sign to indicate positive value
  := = place sign to leftmost position
  :  = insert a space before positive numbers
  :, = comma separator
