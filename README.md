Simple projects that helps alot.

------------------------------------Python------------------------------------------------ 

1. variable = A container for a value(string, integer, float, boolean)
2. Typecasting = the process of canverting a variable from one data type to another
3. input() = a function that prompts the user to enter data returns the entered data as a string
4. IF = Do some code only IF some condition is True
5. ELSE = do something else
6. Logical Operators = evaluate multiple canditions (or, and, not)

    or = at least one candition must be True
   
   and = both conditions must be True
   
   not = inverts the condition (not False, not True)
   
8. Conditional Expression = A one-line shortcut for the if-else sataement (ternary operator)
                          Print or assign one of two values based on a condition
                          X if condition else Y
9. .isalpha() returns boolean if a string only contians alphabetical characters
10. indexing = accessing elements of a sequence using [] (indexing operator)

    [start: end : step]
    
12. format specifiers = {value:flags} format a value based on what flags are inserted
    
      .(number)f = round to that many decimal places (fixed point)
    
      :(number) = allocate that many spaces
    
      :03 = allocate and zero pad that many spaces
    
      :< = left justify
    
      :> = right justify
    
      :^ = center align

      :+ = use a plus sign to indicate positive value
    
      := = place sign to leftmost position
    
      :  = insert a space before positive numbers
    
      :, = comma separator
